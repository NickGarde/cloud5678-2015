	// I can make it move!!! Nolan wouldn't let me copy last year's code until we tested this one, but we never did...

//Copying last year's code is not a good idea because it is a different robot and if you don't write your own code and understand it really well, they you will not be able to make necessary changes on the fly at tournaments --MASON
	//It looked like a good first try, however, some of the code you removed was necessary and I have put it back in and explained it below. I have been programming for many years and am happy to help you. Do not make changes to the code without
		//running it by me first. You can reach me at 713-416-9448 or at mason2smart@gmail.com. We need to work together as a team nobody can win as an individual.
			//The robot was moving under the previous code; all that needed changing were the ports
				//and the motors for the linear slide lift (which no longer exists). ALso, I am adding the Tank drive option back in. As I previously specifically stated in a comment, the tank drive was to be used for DEBUGGING THE DRIVETRAIN in
					//order to make sure all motors are functioning properly with the right speed and torque. Andrew Lynch had asked me to add this to the program.
						//You also deleted the deadband, which made sure no slight false readings came from the joysticks in the controller when the robot is supposed to be stationary. --Mason
